# Audio Tagging

This project was developed for the Description and Retrieval of Audiovisual Content course at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de 
Catalunya. The input data was taken from the 
[Kaggle Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/freesound-audio-tagging). The purpose of this 
project is to implement an audio tagging system consisting of a SVM classifier using MFCC features. Furthermore, PCA was used 
for dimensionality reduction.
